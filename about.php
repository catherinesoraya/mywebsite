		<h4 align="center">1939 - 1974</h4>
	<p>Manucher Yazdanpour was a Plein Air Impressionist painter and still life painter from the mid 20th century, who painted in oils and watercolor. Born and raised in Isfahan, Iran, Manucher  painted beautiful scenes of the villages and countrysides around him, disappearing for days, sometimes a week at a time, in pursuit of the perfect conditions, and coming home exhausted, starving, but mitigated with satisfaction. He started out as a young boy painting store fronts with beautiful calligraphy and advertisements. He gradually moved from offering his services to shopkeepers to what would later become his signature style. Manucher went to a special high-school in Isfahan that specialized in Language and the Arts. It was at this school that Manucher honed his craft and learned english, which later would help him forge a career.</p> 
<p>In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, Manucher started to sell his paintings to American and foreign customers who would later become his friends, and one such customer, John Hanley, would later help Manucher come to the States. It has been said that Manucher was a rare person in Isfahan in the heyday of the early 60’s for possessing qualities that only a handful could appreciate in Iran at that time, which was a small group of artists, musicians, writers, poets, and other like minded individuals. As a result of being open minded, extremely well educated, secular, worldly, and being somebody who didn’t fit with the Iranian Political scene and general Culture, in 1963, Manucher did not get a prestigious scholarship to study painting in France. Manucher lost to another student who had more in common with the status quo (and not necessarily the most talented of the two), and went on to study Interior Design in France. Needless to say, it was disappointing to Manucher, and ultimately was the catalyst for his decision to move to the USA.</p> 
<p>In 1964, Manucher came to the USA to pursue his painting career, following a brief stay in Frankfurt, Germany, and enrolled in Chouinard Art School (California Institute of Art). It was there in Los Angeles that he met the mother of his two boys, Barbara Acklin. The faculty at Chouinard told Manucher there was nothing more they could teach him, and Manucher got a job at Pacific Advertising (painting huge billboards by hand….) from 1965 to 1972 after casually mentioning to his Father in law one day as they were driving in LA that he could paint billboards. His Father in law, who was working in advertising at the time, got Manucher an interview, and the rest is history. From 1965 to 1972, Manucher continued to paint billboards and his Plein Air paintings, and was being represented by a Pasadena person of interest by the name of Honey. She brokered many of Manucher’s sales, and Manucher sold directly to clients at many outdoor art exhibits in Southern California.</p> 
<p>An avid outdoorsman and Angler, Manucher spent a lot of time exploring the hinterlands of California and fishing off the many piers, often times bringing his easel with him, like he did for example when he visited Death Valley and the Mojave Desert, where he did incredible water colors. It was during this period of 1965-1972, that Manucher was diagnosed with depression, and began unsuccessful treatments. In 1972, Manucher decided it was time to move back to Iran. He died in 1974 and is missed greatly by his family in Iran and the USA including his granddaughter, the creator of this website. Through his art and his family, Manucher Yazdanpour will always be remembered. </p>
